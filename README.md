# Secret Prediction market

This is a sample prediction market with a twist.
No one knows other people's answer while submitting their bet so that their prediction is solely based on their own decision without influence of the others.

## Motivation of the project

I added the twist so that I can understand more about understanding encryption and secure verification.
